	1 : "hey kiddo,

mom and dad want you to get a few 
things done before we’re back. we’ll 
be home late tonight, so please go to 
bed early, okay?

- fold your clothes
- unpack your storage box
- put away your toys
- make yourself dinner. there’s some 
pizza in the fridge
- wash the dishes
- brush your teeth

we might not wake you when we get in,
so don’t worry if you hear us moving around.
just stay in bed.
love you.

— mom & dad",
